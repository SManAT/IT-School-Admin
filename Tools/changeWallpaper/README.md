# changeWallpaper

It is written in Python, and will load wallpapers SFTP or a local directory.
If using SFTP, an offline Copy from all wallpapers will be saved to the host.

Why SFTP?  
Because i had massive problem to get network share working right on windows.  
I'm a Linux nerd, so take SFTP ...
